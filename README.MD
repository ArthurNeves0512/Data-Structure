 Encoding/decoding a phrase in morse and puting the respective letter in a binary tree

I needed to do a program that encoding(1) or decoding(0) letters and puting the respective letter in a binary tree and show the binary tree, each "." was saying to put the letter in left leaf and each "-" was saying to the letter put in  right leaf. the " * " is the root.
